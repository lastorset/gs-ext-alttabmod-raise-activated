    "description": "When you Alt+Tab to an app (instead of Alt+<Key Above Tab> to a window), default behavior is to bring up all windows of the selected app and activate the most recently used. This extension modifies Alt+Tab to always bring up only the activated window.\n\nNote: not guaranteed to work together with other extensions that also modify Alt Tab popup. Tested only with 'Alt Tab Workspace' and other 'Alt Tab Mod: ...'.",
